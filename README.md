# Centrality Project

**Description:** CS 406 Project for Parallelizing Centrality Measurements: Degree 1&amp;2, Closeness and Betweenness Centralities

## What Do We Have So Far?

- Large and small graph data,
- Graph and directory files reading functions,
- Closeness Centrality, Degree 1 and 2 implementations,
- Sequential BFS implementation.

## What To Do?

- Implement Betweenness Centrality,
- Parallelize BFS with both CPU and GPU,
- Combine all in a function.
